# AION

AION is a deterministic execution truth layer for debugging, comparison, and reproducible automation.

It captures what actually happened during a command, compares executions deterministically, and explains why they differ.

If you have ever seen the same command succeed once and fail the next time — AION makes the difference visible.

## Why AION exists

Commands do not behave consistently.

The same command can produce different results across machines, environments, or time.

Logs are incomplete.  
Debuggers do not capture environment drift.  
CI systems hide nondeterminism instead of explaining it.

Reproducibility is broken in practice.

AION exists to make execution behavior:

* visible  
* comparable  
* explainable  
* reproducible

## What AION is

AION is a system for deterministic execution analysis.

It is composed of multiple surfaces:

* Repro — deterministic capture, diff, why, replay  
* Graph — execution relationships and causality (future)  
* Envelope — deterministic execution contracts (future)  
* Trace — event-based execution recording (future)  
* Inspect — execution introspection (future)  

Repro is the first available surface.

## 5-second proof

```bash
aion repro run -- echo hello
aion repro diff last prev
aion repro why last prev
```

AION captures executions, compares them, and explains the difference.

What you get
Capture — see exactly what happened during a run

Compare — see what changed between runs

Explain — understand why it changed

Replay — reproduce output without re-running

Artifacts are stored locally under ./repro_runs/.

Installation
From the repository root:

```bash
cargo build --release -p aion -p repro
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```

Quickstart

```bash
aion repro run -- echo hello
aion repro replay last
aion repro diff last prev
aion repro why last prev
```
