# SealRun Execution OS overview

SealRun Execution OS is a **deterministic AI execution OS**: it records runs as **capsules**, verifies them with **replay**, compares them with **drift**, explains them with **Why** and **causal graphs**, and enforces rules through machine-readable **contracts** across governance, reliability, operations, distribution, UX, testing, and measurement.

## At a glance

- Execution-OS + Contract-OS model
- 5 kernel layers for deterministic run execution
- Enterprise-layer contracts across phases 1-12
- Canonical diagnostics and readiness output via `sealrun doctor`

---

SealRun guarantees deterministic execution, replay symmetry, drift detection and audit‑grade evidence chains.  
SealRun intentionally does not enforce filesystem or network isolation.  
The kernel isolation modules are contract surfaces only; they define the interface but do not restrict access.

This is a deliberate design choice: SealRun is an Execution‑OS, not a Security‑Sandbox‑OS.  
Because SealRun does not modify kernel privileges or intercept syscalls, it is safe to adopt in existing environments without admin rights, without risk to workloads, and without operational friction.

If isolation is required (e.g., for regulated industries), the same contract surfaces can be backed by seccomp/landlock/micro‑VM isolation in a future "SealRun Secure Runtime" module — without breaking compatibility.

## Who is this for?

- Teams that need **repeatable** AI runs for testing and audits.
- Tooling authors integrating via the **SDK** or **CLI**.
- Pipelines that emit **JSON / HTML / SVG** artefacts for humans and machines.

## Contract surface

- Kernel-layer contracts: replay, replay invariant, drift, evidence chain, policy engine
- Enterprise-layer contracts: governance, reliability, operations, distribution, UX, tests, measurement
- Cross-cutting contracts: identity, finality, compatibility, trust chain, audit export

## CLI surface

```bash
sealrun doctor
sealrun reliability status
sealrun ops runbooks
sealrun dist status
sealrun governance status
sealrun ux api
sealrun tests strategy
sealrun measure metrics
```

## Enterprise-readiness

- Phase 1-12 contracts are implemented and exposed in deterministic JSON envelopes.
- Enterprise automation should treat CLI JSON outputs as the primary machine contract.

## Enterprise status at a glance

- Phase 1-12 enterprise contracts are implemented in `aion-core` and surfaced in `sealrun doctor`.
- Contract-centric command groups: `reliability`, `ops`, `dist`, `governance`, `ux`, `tests`, `measure`.
- Deterministic JSON envelopes are the default audit interface for automation and compliance tooling.
