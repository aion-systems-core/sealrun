# Contributing to AION

AION is **source-first** today: build from this repository with Cargo. Prebuilt binaries may be published later; until then, treat `cargo build --release -p aion -p repro` as the supported install path.

## Project Identity

**AION** is the stable product name. The public slogan is:

**AION — Make Execution Explainable.**

AION is a deterministic system.

All contributions must preserve determinism.

---

## Principles

* Execution must be reproducible  
* Behavior must be explainable  
* Outputs must be stable  
* Tests must be deterministic  

---

## Commit rules

Every commit must:

* produce the same results when executed multiple times  
* avoid nondeterministic behavior  
* avoid time-based or random outputs unless explicitly controlled  

---

## Testing rules

All tests must:

* pass deterministically  
* not depend on external state  
* not depend on system time or randomness  

Run:

```bash
cargo test -p repro
```

before submitting changes.

---

## Repro validation

Changes must not introduce execution drift.

Recommended validation:

```bash
aion repro run -- cargo test -p repro
aion repro run -- cargo test -p repro
aion repro diff last prev
```

The diff must not show unintended differences.

---

## Review expectations

Reviewers will check:

* deterministic behavior

* absence of drift

* clarity of execution changes

---

## Scope

Public-facing changes should:

* use aion repro ... in examples

* avoid internal terminology

* remain consistent with README.md

---

## Releases

Releases represent stable, reproducible states.

Do not introduce nondeterminism before tagging a release.
