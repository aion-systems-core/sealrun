# Operations guide

## Purpose

Map **deterministic JSON envelopes** from reliability, operations, and measurement domains to **SRE workflows** (incident, change, DR, upgrades) and evidence retention—without restating kernel contracts ([Architecture](architecture.md)).

This guide maps SealRun **contract outputs** to platform and SRE workflows: change management, incidents, upgrades, and evidence retention.

## At a glance

- **Reliability** contracts expose SLO, chaos, and soak readiness as structured JSON.
- **Operations** contracts cover runbooks, incidents, DR, and upgrade/migration status.
- **Measurement** contracts cover metrics, KPIs, audits, and evidence export surfaces.
- **Admission control:** treat `sealrun doctor` plus domain JSON as mandatory artefacts in release pipelines.

Isolation and security posture are **not** implied by deterministic execution alone; align workload boundaries with [Security guide](security-guide.md) and your organisational policy.

## Contract surface (operations-relevant)

- Reliability: `reliability_status`, SLO/chaos/soak projections (see CLI reference for exact command mapping).
- Operations: runbooks, incident model, DR status, upgrade/migration status.
- Measurement: metrics, KPIs, audit reports, evidence export hooks.

## CLI surface

```bash
sealrun doctor
sealrun reliability status
sealrun ops runbooks
sealrun ops incidents
sealrun ops dr
sealrun ops upgrade
sealrun measure kpis
sealrun measure audits
```

## SRE flows

| Scenario | Suggested sequence |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Incident triage** | `sealrun doctor` → `sealrun ops incidents` → attach latest capsule/replay JSON from the affected run. |
| **Change / release** | Baseline `doctor` + domain checks → execute smoke capsule + replay → archive JSON under change record. |
| **DR / restore** | `sealrun ops dr` → verify contract outputs against last known good snapshots. |
| **Upgrade** | `sealrun ops upgrade` → re-run replay/drift on reference capsules before traffic shift. |

## Evidence retention

- Persist **CLI JSON envelopes** as the canonical machine-readable record; retain HTML/SVG only if your audit programme requires human-readable annexes.
- Tie each retention object to a **capsule path** or hash referenced in your CMDB or ticket system.
- For governance baselines, store the **baseline JSON** produced by `ci baseline` (see [CI](ci.md)).

## Tenant lifecycle operations

Use tenant-scoped retention and legal controls as the canonical operations workflow:

```bash
sealrun enterprise tenants create acme
sealrun enterprise lifecycle retention set --tenant acme --days 30
sealrun enterprise lifecycle legal-hold enable --tenant acme
sealrun enterprise lifecycle purge --tenant acme
```

Purge is blocked when legal hold is enabled. Operations teams should use legal hold before investigations or audits.

## SRE workflows and escalation

- Incident playbooks are in `docs/runbooks/`.
- Severity handling and timing targets are in `docs/sla.md`.
- Handoff and ownership progression are in `docs/support-escalation-path.md`.
- Public communication format is in `docs/status-page-template.md`.

## Finality and readiness

Operational **readiness** is the conjunction of: stable contract snapshots, successful replay on reference workloads, acceptable drift against baselines, and no critical gaps in `doctor` and measurement outputs. Exact finality fields are defined in [OS contract spec](os_contract_spec.md).

## Enterprise documentation map (determinism, evidence, governance)

Use these when tying SRE workflows to **tenant isolation**, **RBAC**, **OIDC**, **replay**, **drift**, the **evidence chain**, **SIEM** / **OTel**, and **Cosign** / **Sigstore** **attestation** with **SBOM** archives:

- [Trust Center](trust-center.md) — consolidated capability and evidence sources
- [Multi-tenancy](multi-tenancy.md), [Lifecycle controls](lifecycle-controls.md), [RBAC](rbac.md), [OIDC auth](oidc-auth.md)
- [SIEM and OTel](siem-otel.md), [Release attestation](release-attestation.md), [Policy engine](policy-engine.md)
- Runbooks: `docs/runbooks/` — replay failure, drift anomaly, evidence corruption, tenant isolation, exporter failure
- SLA and escalation: [SLA](sla.md), [Support escalation path](support-escalation-path.md), [Status page template](status-page-template.md)
