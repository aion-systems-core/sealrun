# Pilot onboarding — Install

## Purpose

First pilot step: obtain a **`sealrun` binary** from this workspace and run smoke commands before capsules and replay ([next step](01_execute_capsule.md)).

**Goal:** Build the CLI and run your first command in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (`cargo`, stable recommended).
- Clone this repository.

## Build

```bash
cargo build -p aion-cli
```

Invoke via `sealrun <subcommand>` or add `target/debug` to your `PATH`.

## Sanity checks

```bash
sealrun doctor
sealrun setup
```

## Next

- [01 — Execute capsule](01_execute_capsule.md)
